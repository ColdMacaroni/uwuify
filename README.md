# uwuify
Converts your text to uwu speak. Yeah.

## How to run
I compiled it with `clang -Wall -pedantic -Wextra -o uwuify uwuify.c` and there wasn't even a single note or warning so i am quite proud of that

After you compile it just run it with ./uwuify or whatever the file name is and thats that.  
e.g. `./uwuify Hello gamers what is up`  
Output: `Hewwo gamews what is up -w-`

## Other stuff
If you have more suggestions for owo rules or things that go at the end just open an issue

Also there is not support for piping ill do that eventually i guess
